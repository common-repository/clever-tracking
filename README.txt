Track how many clicks your links get. 

== Description ==

= Clever Tracking =

The Clever Tacking helps website owners better understand how site visitors 
interact with links on their site.  The main function of the plugin is to track clicks as they 
occur on a website in real time.  Clever Tacking uses client side 
Javascript to record all outbound and inbound click events and record them through your supplied api.  


Why track clicks? 

By tracking and recording where and how your visitors click and leave your site, you can 
optimize your website and pages for increased revenue and undestand visitors.

**Demonstrate advertising value**

If you have website sponsors or advertisers, the external click data can be invaluable.  
Your clients might not be sophisticated enough to check their own website analytics, 
so you can provide them with the data yourself; how well did the ad perform, how many 
users left your sites for theirs through the ad in question?  From that they can develop 
a Return On Investment number for the cost of your campaign.

**See where your site visitors go next**

If the bulk of your visitors are leaving your website for a specific destination, 
maybe there's room for extra content on your own site.  
Why send your traffic elsewhere if you can meet your visitors' needs yourself?


Why Clever Tacking? 

Once you install the plugin and add the setting value than you will start receiving clicked 
link detail to your api. You don't need to subscribe to our site, our newsletter, or any 
other signup form. Download, install, go to setting page and add your api url and start.
